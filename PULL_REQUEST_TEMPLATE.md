#### Single-line Summary
**Today, John and Zach paired together. It took about 3hrs 40mins**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First we added the script file for the new JS sheet.
  2. Next, we added the data-author attribute the same way as the data-category.
  3. Next, we made it so the author that was selected article showed up by hiding all the other articles and then showing the element with the data-author attribute.
  4. Next, we made it so if the author selection was blank all of the articles showed up.
  5. Next, we added the category filter functionality in a similar fashion to the author filter.
  6. Next, we added functionality for the tags 'about' and 'articles' by hiding them both and then showing the one that is clicked on.
  7. Then we add the functionality for the 'read-on' element so that the selected paragraph shows the rest of its content.
  8. Then we called the functions.
  9. Finally, added some CSS to make it look better.
